My logic for The Farmer Was Replaced.

## TFWR? Eli5
**The Farmer Was Replaced** is a fun, coding-based farming game where you program a drone (using a Python-like language) to plant, water, and harvest crops - earning resources and unlocking new tech as it runs - all while you sit back and watch automation in action. Realistically you'll be debugging why it is not working as expected, but in a perfect world, that is the gist of it.
As you progress through the game the farming becomes less farm-y and more data-science-y.
